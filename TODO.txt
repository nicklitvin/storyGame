TODO
add testBoundary to storage
audio playing
pausing
Make events belong to Game object

FOR LATER
create txt file that takes user input and creates scenes
dont keep track of mouse when not necessary during scene
preload everything, loading screen
caching mp3 files
add about page
localStorage: store scene, events
class diagram to easily rearrange scenes, LinkedList-like
easter egg for changing localstorage
should pause restart audio? probably not

GAME TESTS
    Keep mouse within moving circle
        boundary jerks with audio
        mouse not on page focus = cheating
